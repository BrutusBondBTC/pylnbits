# lnbitsbot

starter template for running bots based off of lnbits 

Just my quick and dirty setup using lnbits as the backend for a python TG bot
that can: 

- create a wallet on lnbits tied to a TG username
- TG users can send links to nonTG users
- link user to lnbits web interface so they can use and add features
- send/receive/tips to other TG users
- gift sats with custom image and message. unclaimed sats should expire and return to sender
- instructions with easy on ramp for users who don't hold sats or bitcoin
